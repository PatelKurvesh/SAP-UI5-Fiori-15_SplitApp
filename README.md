# SAP-UI5-Fiori-15_SplitApp
A SplitApp in SAP UI5 is a container control that allows you to split the screen into two areas: a master area and a detail area. The master area typically contains a list of items, while the detail area displays the details of the selected item. This type of layout is commonly used in mobile applications, where screen real estate is limited.

In the SplitApp control, the master area can be hidden to show only the detail area, providing more screen space for the content. This layout allows for efficient use of screen space, and allows the user to focus on the relevant information. When the master area is hidden, the user can access it by tapping on a button or swiping from the edge of the screen. The SplitApp control provides a flexible and responsive layout that can adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
